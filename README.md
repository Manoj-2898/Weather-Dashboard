# Weather Dashboard

This is a Vite + React Weather Dashboard starter. It uses Tailwind CSS, OpenWeatherMap API, Chart.js and Leaflet.

Quick start:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add `VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`.
2. From the `Weather-Dashboard` folder run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be at `http://localhost:5173` by default.
